"""
Follow-up state machine service.

This service implements the outreach lifecycle for each customer:
- NEW_LEAD -> CONTACTED -> (FOLLOWUP_1 -> FOLLOWUP_2 -> FOLLOWUP_3) -> STOPPED
- EMAIL_OPENED / REPLIED are event-driven states that can interrupt the sequence.

Key fields:
- sequence_step: how many times we have sent an email to this customer
- last_contacted_at: timestamp of last send (used to determine due follow-ups)
- next_action: a simple label to guide UI/automation

This module is intentionally deterministic: given the same inputs, it produces the same state.
